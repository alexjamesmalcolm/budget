There's another site that I used to use for planning how much of my paycheck I was going to put towards savings but I found that it updated slowly and the UI was starting to get on my nerves. So I created my own budgeting app. It uses a machine's localStorage so there's no need to make an account but as a result your data is locked to each device. New features coming at my own convenience.

I created the site using lit-html. I would normally use React but GitHub pages doesn't support frameworks that require build processes. I would switch to AWS but I like how fast and simple deploying to GitHub pages is, you just have to get over not being able to use Angular, Vue, or React.
